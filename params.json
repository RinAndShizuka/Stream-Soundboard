{"name":"Client-Soundboard","tagline":"A soundboard that doesn't store files.","body":"# Client-Soundboard\r\n\r\nThis soundboard is a Project that lets you\r\nstream audio to your Virtual Audio Cable/Voicemeeter input.\r\n\r\nCurrently in early Pre-Release and really messy.\r\nJoin the [Discord](https://discord.gg/Tgf2BKD) for help\r\n\r\n## It supports:\r\n* Youtube links\r\n* Youtube search\r\n* Vimeo links\r\n* Soundcloud links\r\n* Bandcamp links\r\n* Direct links to files\r\n\r\nIt's based on [Lavaplayer](https://github.com/sedmelluq/lavaplayer \"Lavaplayer\").\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nHead over to [Releases](https://github.com/RinLovesYou/Stream-Soundboard/releases) and grab the latest stable.\r\nThe installer will install it for you.\r\n\r\nMake sure Voicemeeter Banana is installed, Here is a small [Guide](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/733272631268343860/734329691988557824/le_image.png?width=1539&height=866) on how to set it up correctly (also found on my [discord](https://discord.gg/Tgf2BKD) ;)\r\n\r\nIn the soundboard, the output will automatically be set to Voicemeeter. If not, the dropdown to choose is below the Skip and Stop buttons.\r\n\r\n**If Voicemeeter Inputs do not appear, you do not have Voicemeeter installed! check the Requirements section below for links!**\r\n\r\nYou may also want to build it yourself (for whatever reason)\r\nI wish you luck on your journey of installing Java 8 and getting baffled by how retarded JavaFX is.\r\n\r\n### Planned Features\r\n* History of played links\r\n* More detailed UI\r\n\r\n#### Requirements\r\n* [Java 8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jre8-downloads.html) (most definitely probably Java 8) Most people probably have this version installed anyways,\r\nto check which version you have type `java -version` in the command line (Windows key + R, type cmd and press enter)\r\n* [Virtual Audio Cable](https://www.vb-audio.com/Cable/index.htm) or [Voicemeeter](https://www.vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/banana.htm) I recommend Voicemeeter Banana.\r\n* Currently only on Windows. I will look into cross platform distribution\r\n\r\n##### Special Thanks\r\n* SoundPad CEO for making me pay for something that i have to manually download files to\r\n\r\n[![ko-fi](https://www.ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/K3K61YCS7)\r\n\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
