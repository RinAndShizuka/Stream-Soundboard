# Client-Soundboard
A soundboard that doesn't store files.

This soundboard is a (currently) closed source Project that lets you
stream audio to your Virtual Audio Cable/Voicemeeter input.

Currently in early Pre-Release and really messy.

It supports:
* Youtube links
* Youtube search
* Vimeo links
* Soundcloud links
* Bandcamp links
* Direct links to files

It's based on [Lavaplayer](https://github.com/sedmelluq/lavaplayer "Lavaplayer").

## Installation
Head over to [Releases](https://github.com/RinLovesYou/Stream-Soundboard/releases) and grab the latest stable.
Double click the exe and it should work

### Planned Features
* History of played links
* nicer UI
* Playback of Playlists/Albums in order
* actually learning C# Graphical User Interfaces

#### Requirements
* Java
* Virtual Audio Cable
* Voicemeeter (Optional but needed for volume control)

##### Special Thanks
* SoundPad CEO for making me pay for something that i have to manually download files to
