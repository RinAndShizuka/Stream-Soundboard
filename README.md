This soundboard is a Project that lets you
stream audio to your Virtual Audio Cable/Voicemeeter input.

Currently in early Pre-Release and really messy.

## It supports:
* Youtube links
* Youtube search
* Vimeo links
* Soundcloud links
* Bandcamp links
* Direct links to files

It's based on [Lavaplayer](https://github.com/sedmelluq/lavaplayer "Lavaplayer").

## Installation
Head over to [Releases](https://github.com/RinLovesYou/Stream-Soundboard/releases) and grab the latest stable.
The installer will install it for you.

Make sure Voicemeeter Banana is installed, Here is a small [Guide](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/733272631268343860/734329691988557824/le_image.png?width=1539&height=866) on how to set it up correctly (also found on my [discord](https://discord.gg/Tgf2BKD) ;)

In the soundboard, the output will automatically be set to Voicemeeter. If not, the dropdown to choose is below the Skip and Stop buttons.

**If Voicemeeter Inputs do not appear, you do not have Voicemeeter installed! check the Requirements section below for links!**

You may also want to build it yourself (for whatever reason)
I wish you luck on your journey of installing Java 8 and getting baffled by how retarded JavaFX is.

### Planned Features
* History of played links
* nicer UI
* actually learning JavaFX User Interfaces

#### Requirements
* [Java 8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jre8-downloads.html) (most definitely probably Java 8) Most people probably have this version installed anyways,
to check which version you have type `java -version` in the command line (Windows key + R, type cmd and press enter)
* [Virtual Audio Cable](https://www.vb-audio.com/Cable/index.htm) or [Voicemeeter](https://www.vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/banana.htm) I recommend Voicemeeter Banana.
* Tested only on Windows but cross platform may work? you can definitely run `help.jar` in the app subfolder of the install location provided you have Java 8

##### Special Thanks
* SoundPad CEO for making me pay for something that i have to manually download files to
